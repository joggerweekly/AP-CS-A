A True IDE, such as vs code (with Java extension) with local JDK, is faster, more powerful and efficient, due to the nature of being local instead of web-based. Please give it a try!

Many free code/lab samples on github assume the local installation of JDK

vs code can be used for multiple languages, such as javascrip, python, sql, java/C# etc.
vs code is widely used by professionals.

Reference:
official doc of JDK:
